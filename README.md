I'm **Shubham Patel**, a 2023 B.Tech graduate from **DAIICT, Gandhinagar**.  
I'm a curious and passionate software developer with a strong **growth mindset**. I believe in continuously learning and building a solid foundation to become a better problem-solver and engineer.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**, a well-structured and comprehensive guide for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.

I’m working through the sheet step by step as a way to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills 🧩

All solutions are written with clean code and meaningful comments to help others understand the logic easily.


I'll be regularly updating the solutions as I progress through the sheet.
